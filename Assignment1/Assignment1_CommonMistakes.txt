Assignment 1 Grading Common Mistakes:
Geometry.cpp:
  Barycentric Coordinates:
    Forgetting to check for zero division
    Not using the epsilon
    Not filling out the barycentric coords when the test returns false
  PointSphere and PointAabb:
    Not properly handling "<=" vs. "<"
  RayPlane:
    Not properly checking for a parallel ray
    Using epsilon to check t
  RayTriangle: 
    Not using epsilon
    Not early outing if the ray doesn't hit the plane
  RaySphere:
    The ray missing the sphere
    The ray hitting the sphere but 1 or more t is invalid
  RayAabb:
    Calling RayPlane
    Zero divisions (not handling a ray direction being 0)
  Frustum Tests:
    Not correctly handling intersection vs. outside. See notes for an explanation)
  
Shapes.cpp:
  Plane::Set: Not dealing with the plane normal being normalized
  
Allocations in any function, especially PlaneTriangle.
