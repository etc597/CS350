Assignment 4 Grading Common Mistakes:
BspTree.cpp:
  SplitTriangle:
    Not doing the 9 case table
    Not handling coplanar triangles
    Incorrect splitting of quads
  CalculateScore:
    Including coplanar triangles
  TreeConstruction:
    Picking zero vector split planes
  RayCasting:
    Checking all triangles. This will lose most if not all points!
    Not using the provided epsilons
    Not handling the edge cases
    Not using tMin/tMax
  DebugDraw:
    Not using level
    Modifying a copy instead of a reference
  Invert:
    Incorrectly flipping a plane (not just negating .xyz)
