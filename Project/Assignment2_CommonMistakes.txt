Assignment 2 Grading Common Mistakes:
Shapes.cpp:
  Sphere:
    ComputeCentroid:
      Using the aabb's "radius" instead of finding the furthest away point
    ComputeRitter:
      Not properly choosing the axis with the longest length (actual point distance)
    ComputeJacobiRotation:
      Not finding the largest magnitude off diagonal element
    ComputeEigenValuesAndVectors:
      Not iterating
    ComputePCA:
      Not calling the above helper functions
      Not finding the furthest points along the axis of most spread and then expanding the sphere iteratively
  Aabb:
    Transform:
      Transforming all 8 points
      Not properly applying scale or translation
    
SimpleNSquared.cpp:
  Insert/Update/Remove:
    Not being constant time to find the item
    Id being unstable
    Using mClientData for more than storage (don't read it!)
    Having a fixed size array that doesn't handle more than a reasonable number of objects
  Queries:
    Checking invalid nodes
  DebugDrawing:
    Setting properties on a copy instead of the reference
